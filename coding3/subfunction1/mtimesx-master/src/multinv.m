function X = multinv(M)
% function X = multinv(M)
%
% PURPOSE: Inverse each 2D slice of an array (M) with arbitrary dimensions 
%          support.
%
% INPUT
%   M  : n_D array (m x m x [p x q x ...]), for all possible m=1,2,3,... 
%        and optional higher dimensions.
%   
% OUTPUT
%   X  : n_D array (m x m x [p x q x  ...]), with same size as M.
%
% Inverse every 2D slice (the first two dimensions of M) for multi-dimension
% array M.
%   M(:,:,p,q,...) * X(:,:,p,q,...) = repmat(eye(m),[1,1,p,q,...])
%
% NOTE 1 -- This function may use a large amount of memory for huge array. 
%           Test before usage.
%
% NOTE 2 -- Underdetermined system (more unknowns than equation)
%   The solution is basic solution obtained with sparse mldivide
%   which is not the same as basic solution when calling for full matrix.
