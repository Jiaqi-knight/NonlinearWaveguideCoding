%  DESCRIPTION
%
%  A function to mesh a non-simply connected, i.e. with rectangular holes,
%  rectangular geometry with rectangular elements
%
%  Input: x0 - scalar - x-coordinate of center
%         y0 - scalar - y-coordinate of center
%         lx - [M x 1] vector - Side length in each one of the M mesh regions in x-direction
%         ly - [N x 1] vector - Side length in each one of the N mesh regions in y-direction
%         Nx - [M x 1] vector - Number of ELEMENTS in each one of the M mesh regions in x-direction
%         Ny - [N x 1] vector - Number of ELEMENTS in each one of the N mesh regions in y-direction
%         holes - [H x 4] matrix - H is the number of holes; for each hole the following data must pe provided:
%                                  xC - scalar - x-coordinate of hole's center
%                                  yC - scalar - y-coordinate of hole's center
%                                  xL - scalar - half-length of side parallel to x-axis
%                                  yL - scalar - half-length of side parallel to y-axis
