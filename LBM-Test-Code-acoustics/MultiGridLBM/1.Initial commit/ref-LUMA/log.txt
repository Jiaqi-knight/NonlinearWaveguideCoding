f5e46dc781bcc50546f7479477142f0aab5fab53 Fix for Issue #155
e936283336297415c3359728a91669af670603b9 Solved bug in the Debug_cloud option. Needs to be solved in the master branch too.
a05bb1698e74a4f2c3cfc85109fcef6c8d042d11 Only the distribution functions are written in the restart file. When the restart file is read in the macroscopic quantities are calculated from the read distribution functions. The velocity and density values are not exactly the same as the ones at the end of the simulation that wrote the restart file; they are very close though. I don't think the discrepancies between the two are relevant.

cc2271191d3329b7f8a609686c4553a0627d38a7 Standardisation of the numbering of lattice directions and updates to boundary conditions as required.
5a74e25bda5b5cd89525364a98c3e8312b5721fb Moved MATLAB tools to own folder and added relative paths as necessary
8714c1b50144f36dbd6b35d337a24848698fd374 GCC (g++) compiler support added by removal of non-standard functions. Inline operator definitions added for speed on older compilers. Note: This source code will now compile on Linux systems using GCC with the -std=c++11 flag to ensure c+11 standard is followed. The easiest way to do this is to create a Code::Blocks project and import the source files and enable the c+11 option under compiler options.
c20aa8b607d9688fd714fd363d72c1ba006c0bc8 Improved commenting and organisation of case assembly code for clarity. Other minor updates to post processing tools.
4e3be7d6a3e848937f17f1452b743f02e0d22081 Filament-based plates added. Further details: -- JacMovie updated to BodyMovie as can plot the position of any body not just Jacowires -- View updates in nBodyPlot -- Filament-based coupled plates added as IB option -- Uncoupled filament array added as IB option -- Group ID added to IB_body class for grouping bodies for common activities (e.g. position copies) -- Deformable property added to IB_body to allow a body to be deformed without it being flexible (which would require a structural calculation). Deformable, but inflexible bodies can be deformed by external forcing functions or by copying the positions from another body in a group for example. A flexible deformable body will always look to call the Jacowire to compute the deformation. -- Handle error if jacowire fails -- Positional update routine now governs mechanism for deformations based on body properties -- Initial framework for OMP included
54596c182bbc7fa7d7372f1db8fa11b0c2ad12fe Flexible Filaments Added. Other minor improvements include: -- Body building routines to add a filament (if specified as rigid, this doubles as a plate in 2D) -- Methods for construction and solution of Jacobian Wire (Jacowire) structural mechanics problem -- IO operation for writing out the Jacowire coordinates when other data written -- Jacowire calculation for flexible bodies as well as support recalculation added for moving body -- Gravity direction changed to +x direction to be consistent with Jacowire -- flex_rigid property added to body to specify whether it has flexible or rigid markers -- Flexural rigidity added and better commenting of IB_body properties -- Additional quantities written out to log file
01e6fb32f926983b028c47df0a75222925bd6092 nBody IBM update: -- Code now allows for multiple IB bodies in the IBM -- Example of both circular and rectangular cylinder in channel configured -- New implementation of uniform point seeding for rectangle and cuboids to make it more robust -- Lspace renamed num_markers for clarity -- Prefab body placement has a custom constructor now -- Old MATLAB_reader replaced with nBodyPlot -- nBodyPlot examples provided in Output folder -- Old text output removed -- Some changes to log file content
9d8e38fab4b6084b7fb83fa8222ff8b46ef956cc *** FIXED *** IBM. Other updates as follows: -- Log file facility added for main screen prints to allow simulation parameters to be check at runtime. -- Ability to adjust how many timesteps before writing to file to speed up longer simulations. -- Allow initialisation with no flow using a switch. -- Speed up labelling using std::fill instead of loops. -- Added Reynolds number definition for flows with solid blocks. -- Bug fixes in Guo forcing -- Rearranged declarations to save memory -- Tweaked gravity implementation slightly although needs validation still -- Definitions set up an IBM cylinder in a channel at Re = 100.
25e1b5ac80faa22c12fd2a8491da022ae174cece Improved scaling understanding and non-dimensionalisation of IBM. -- User may now specify a Reynolds number and an input lattice velocity and the lattice viscosity is computed.
c34558c08206c0aada1a4735db7a543213882e88 Tool to plot the IB body and its support in MATLAB. Input data is verbose IBM output which can be turned on in the definitions file.
2a3d8da62ec783e54b0caa65e9f1fc53416d9d7e IBM **** NOTE ***** There is still a bug in this somewhere, if having trouble with the code then turn off IBM or checkout an earlier commit. Details as follows: -- Improved commenting -- Fixed bug in Inlet BC -- Fixed some typos -- Improved documentation in preparation for IBM update -- Guo forcing added -- IBM body and marker classes added -- All methods necessary for IBM as well as restructuring of core to allow for predictor-corrector approach
aada12694c3bbb564d97d8dc1d779b9ac5177029 Auto index flattening and VTK writer. Details: -- "intelligent vector" class added <ivector> which auto flattens arrays to save all the calls to idxmap. -- idxmap removed as superceded by new ivector class -- updates to ivector throughout -- VTK writer added -- indmapref moved to generic operations
a08c233b75c3b8215a05f429ccc0cf983dd4c6d3 Boundary condition inclusion :: -- Inlet (Zou-He), Outlet (extrapolation) and solid wall (bounceback) boundary conditions added. -- Inlet is considered lef thand wall, outlet right hand wall for now. -- Solid site walls can be on the edge or in the middle -- Ensight writer includes blanking although not proven to work yet -- on to-do list -- Test case changed to flow around a block
ae06f9011b1c54d4d661642e2288009a801b5035 Removed VS files to clean up repo and make it more readable
ec1147adba75b95fd0e5b9c0cca5cc70834b5675 Multi-grid Ensight writer implemented so results can be read by Paraview. Changed from binary to ASCII format so easier to debug issues at the potential expense of portability.
ef4c6567a5e8ecb1a0f6e2703ebe3b01fceb7b89 Improved grid checking, conversion to unsigned integers where necessary, removal of deprecated int2str() in place of to_string().
4e6200b8e8646d1501ff2112f38ef00d9174ce64 New diagrams, sample text output and project files for VS for new implementation.

a67d6acefada068c75f6a5e94840940a7d60e4a6 Initial commit of the LBM module of the new code. Will compile and run in both 2D and 3D for single and one level of refinement. More levels not tested. PDF file included which should help explain the overall flow and the main data structure available globally.
