# CavityFlowInLBMInMATLAB
## :floppy_disk:Cavity Lid-driven flow in Lattice Boltzmann Method, MATLAB implementation.
> This repository is part of my undergraduate B.Eng. Thesis.
> I had written several codes for my B.Eng. Thesis, Including MATLAB codes for Lid-driven Flow and parallel Fortran codes to compute co-laminar flow with mass transfer.
> For the MATLAB codes, I designed three version of codes, one was implemented by for-loop while others was implemented by vectorization. My purpose is to show
> the running speed and the better way for MATLAB programming.
