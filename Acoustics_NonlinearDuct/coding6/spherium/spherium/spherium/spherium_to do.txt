Potential future modifications to spherium.m

Andy French. 14th Feb 2012

1) Add a second light source. Independent controls of colour and light position. DONE
2) Major refactor. Common GUI functions, callbacks in separate files.
3) PDF of instructions with illustrations.
4) Plug in spheria architecture, with each spheria type auto generating edit boxes! 
(Rather than dis-enabling parts of the GUI as currently happens).
5) Enable colorbars and axes to be plotted during PNG save mode. DONE
6) Construct spheria gallery. Online and possibly in an art gallery! ONGOING
7) Make the cropped figure pre PNG construction slightly bigger. Perhaps full screen? DONE
8) Ammonite bump amplitude is actually ammonite ridge amplitude....
9) Investigate how to apply textures, holes and transparency in a non-distorted manner. Possibly via tiling? Define surfaces in u,v to avoid angular distortion?
10) Code review for speed and memory efficiency. unit8 rather than doubles etc....
11) Port to C#....
12) Modify ammonite to construct spiral horns, possibly curved. This may mean parameterizing the extruded ellipse radius in a different way. Perhaps a more efficient 
way of encoding ammonite via the GUI? Let spiral function be a function like the spherical function (but this time one parameter, t).
13) 3D rotation should be relative to current view, not an absolute coordinate set.
